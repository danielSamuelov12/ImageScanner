# How to Scan or Upload Images to Extract Text

### **How to Scan or Upload an Image**

1. **Scanning an Image**:
   - If your system is connected to a scanner, click the **Scan** button within the application to initiate the scan.
   - After scanning, the image will automatically be processed, and text extraction will begin.

2. **Uploading an Image**:
   - Click the **Upload Image** button to choose an image file from your computer.
   - Select the image you want to extract text from (common formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`).
   - Once uploaded, the image will be processed for text extraction.

3. **Extract Text from Image**:
   - Once the image is uploaded or scanned, the text will be automatically extracted using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
   - The extracted text will be displayed on the screen.
   - You can copy or save the text to a file for later use.

### **Supported File Formats**
- `.png`
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
- `.bmp`

### **Troubleshooting**
- Ensure that the image is clear and the text is legible for better OCR results.
- If you encounter any issues with text extraction, try uploading a higher-quality image or adjust the scan resolution.
